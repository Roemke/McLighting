tried to use an interrupt and run into problems:
- interrupt works as expected
- if one interrupt is rised nothing else works:
  * light can't be switched
  * webserver isn't responding any more 
  -> maybe my interrupt is interrupted by another one?
  -> maybe the problem is that I use variables which are not volatile
  ok, if I just set a flag in the interrupt handler it works as expected

tried to experiment with different pir sensors 
fat pir hc sr501 is to sensitive often is triggered by movement of neighbour
tried microwave sensor - forgot the problems

tried pir hw-456-sr505
scheint besser zu gehen, laesst sich gut abschirmen, bleibt ca 8s
auf high wenn eine bewegung erkannt wird, bleibt auf high solange sich etwas
bewegt
